# Excel-gradebook

This is a macro-enabled Excel workbook for entering and displying statistical data for graded assignments. Currently, the example is modelled after a standard General Chemistry Lab course. The distribution of scores is automatically calculated and displayed in a histogram below the data. This histogram can be switched to display the course total, quiz scores, or report scores. Additionally, the raw data can be exported to a CSV file that can be quickly uploaded to an online gradebook.
